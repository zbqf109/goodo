# goodo
A odoo fork to provide some new features.

## About odoo
odoo is a powerful and all\-in\-one software solution for ERP and CRM.

## About goodo
odoo's Problem is that it is *all\-in\-one*. Sometimes it is none of your business what has to be done, where to store data and files and how it is updated when changes are made. So goodo lets things to be more flexible and things do right things.

There are several steps following:

1. Remove dependencies on `werkzeug` so it can be deployed on any WSGI compatible server;
    * in progress

2. Postgresql should be optional and other databases are alternative;
    * in progress

3. Porting to python 3.
    * to do

Any of the 3 steps is not easy to be done and will take a long time.

## Current progressing

Database.
